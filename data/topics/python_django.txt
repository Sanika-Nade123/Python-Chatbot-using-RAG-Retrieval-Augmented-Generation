Django is a high-level Python web framework that follows the MVT (Model-View-Template) pattern. It emphasizes rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.

Models define database structure using Python classes. Django's ORM handles database operations, supporting multiple database backends.

Views handle request processing and return responses. Class-based views provide reusable, extensible ways to handle common web development patterns.

Templates manage presentation using Django's template language. Template inheritance and filters provide powerful ways to structure and manipulate content.

URL routing maps URLs to views using regular expressions or path converters. URL patterns can include parameters for dynamic routing.

Django's admin interface automatically generates an admin panel based on models, providing a ready-to-use interface for data management.
