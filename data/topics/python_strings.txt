Strings in Python are immutable sequences of characters. They can be created using single, double, or triple quotes for multi-line strings.

String methods include upper(), lower(), strip(), split(), join(), replace(), and many more. These methods return new strings as strings are immutable.

String formatting can be done using % operator, .format() method, or f-strings (formatted string literals). F-strings are the most modern and readable approach.

String slicing allows extracting substrings using index notation [start:end:step]. Negative indices count from the end of the string.

Python strings support concatenation using + operator and repetition using * operator. The len() function returns the length of a string.

Special characters can be represented using escape sequences like \n (newline), \t (tab), \\ (backslash), and more.
