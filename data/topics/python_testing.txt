Python testing frameworks include unittest, pytest, and doctest. Unit tests verify individual components work correctly.

Test fixtures provide setup and cleanup for tests. Pytest's fixture system is particularly powerful and flexible.

Mocking replaces real objects with test doubles. The unittest.mock module provides tools for creating mock objects.

Test coverage measures code execution during tests. Tools like coverage.py generate reports showing untested code.

Integration tests verify component interactions. End-to-end tests check complete system functionality.

Test-driven development (TDD) writes tests before implementation. This ensures code meets requirements and remains maintainable.
