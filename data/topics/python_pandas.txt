Pandas provides high-performance data structures and tools for data analysis. The DataFrame is its primary object, representing tabular data.

Data manipulation in Pandas includes filtering, sorting, grouping, merging, and reshaping operations. The loc and iloc indexers enable powerful data selection.

Time series functionality in Pandas handles dates and times efficiently, supporting various frequencies, resampling, and rolling window calculations.

Data cleaning features include handling missing values, removing duplicates, and type conversion. The fillna() and dropna() methods manage missing data.

Input/output operations support multiple formats including CSV, Excel, SQL databases, and JSON. The read_csv() function is commonly used for data import.

Pandas integrates well with other libraries like NumPy and Matplotlib, making it essential for data analysis workflows.
