Exception handling in Python uses try-except blocks to manage runtime errors gracefully. The try block contains code that might raise exceptions.

Multiple except blocks can handle different types of exceptions. The else block executes if no exception occurs, and finally always executes.

Custom exceptions can be created by inheriting from built-in Exception class. They help create meaningful error messages specific to your application.

The raise statement manually triggers exceptions. It's useful for enforcing conditions or indicating error states in your code.

Context managers (with statement) automatically handle resource cleanup, commonly used with files, network connections, and database operations.

Best practices include catching specific exceptions rather than using bare except, and avoiding catching all exceptions unless absolutely necessary.
