Python offers two main types of loops: for and while. For loops are used to iterate over sequences like lists, tuples, strings, or range objects.

While loops execute a block of code as long as a condition is true. They're useful when you don't know the exact number of iterations needed.

Loop control statements include break (exit loop), continue (skip to next iteration), and else (execute when loop completes normally).

Nested loops are loops within loops, commonly used for working with multi-dimensional data structures or complex iterations.

Python's for loops are actually foreach loops, making them more intuitive for iterating over collections. The range() function helps when you need traditional counting loops.

List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists using loops in a single line, making code more readable and efficient.
