Sets are unordered collections of unique elements in Python. They eliminate duplicates automatically and support mathematical set operations.

Set operations include union (|), intersection (&), difference (-), and symmetric difference (^). These operations work between multiple sets.

Set methods like add(), remove(), discard(), and pop() modify set contents. The frozen set type creates immutable sets.

Set comprehensions provide concise creation syntax, similar to list comprehensions but with curly braces.

Sets are optimized for membership testing using 'in' operator. They're useful for removing duplicates from sequences.

Set theory operations make sets ideal for comparing collections and finding common or unique elements.
