Functions in Python are blocks of reusable code that perform specific tasks. They are defined using the 'def' keyword, followed by the function name and parameters.

Python functions can return multiple values as tuples. The return statement exits the function and optionally passes back a value to the caller.

Parameters can have default values, making them optional when calling the function. Python also supports keyword arguments, allowing parameters to be passed in any order.

Lambda functions are small, anonymous functions defined using the 'lambda' keyword. They can have any number of arguments but only one expression.

Function decorators modify the behavior of functions or classes. They are a powerful way to add functionality to existing code without directly modifying it.

Python supports recursive functions, which call themselves. They're useful for tasks like traversing tree structures or calculating factorials.
