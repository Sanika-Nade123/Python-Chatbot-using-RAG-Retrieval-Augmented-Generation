The math module provides mathematical functions and constants. Common functions include sqrt(), ceil(), floor(), and trigonometric operations.

Mathematical constants like pi and e are provided with high precision. These are useful in scientific and engineering calculations.

Complex number support uses the cmath module. It provides mathematical operations for complex numbers including phase and magnitude.

Numerical operations include rounding functions, absolute values, and power functions. Integer division and modulo operations have specific behaviors.

Statistical functions in statistics module provide mean, median, mode, and variance calculations. These complement math module functionality.

Random number generation uses the random module. It provides various distribution types and sampling methods.
