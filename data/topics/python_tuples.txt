Tuples are immutable sequences in Python. They're created using parentheses and can contain elements of different types.

Tuple packing and unpacking allow multiple assignment and value swapping. The comma is what makes a tuple, not parentheses.

Tuples are commonly used for returning multiple values from functions. Their immutability makes them suitable as dictionary keys.

Named tuples from collections module provide field names for tuple elements, making code more readable and maintainable.

Tuple methods are limited due to immutability, but include count() and index(). Slicing works similar to lists.

Performance benefits include faster creation and smaller memory footprint compared to lists due to immutability.
