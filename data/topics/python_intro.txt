Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. Created by Guido van Rossum in 1991, Python emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace.

Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.

Python features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management. It has a large and comprehensive standard library, often described as having "batteries included" philosophy.

Python's simplicity makes it an excellent choice for beginners. Its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than languages like C++ or Java.

The language's core philosophy is summarized in "The Zen of Python": beautiful is better than ugly, explicit is better than implicit, simple is better than complex, complex is better than complicated.

Python's versatility allows it to be used in web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, automation, and many other fields.
