DateTime handling in Python uses the datetime module. It provides classes for working with dates, times, and time intervals.

The datetime class combines date and time information. Common operations include formatting, arithmetic, and timezone conversions.

Timedelta objects represent time differences. They're useful for date arithmetic and calculating time intervals between dates.

Timezone handling uses the pytz library. It provides accurate timezone databases and conversion utilities for international applications.

String parsing and formatting use strftime() and strptime() methods. Format codes like %Y, %m, %d specify how dates should be represented.

Time operations include current time retrieval, timestamp conversion, and calendar calculations using the calendar module.
