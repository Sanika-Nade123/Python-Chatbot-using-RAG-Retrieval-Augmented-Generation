Machine Learning algorithms are categorized into supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. Supervised learning uses labeled data for prediction, unsupervised learning finds patterns in unlabeled data, and reinforcement learning learns through environment interaction.

Feature engineering transforms raw data into meaningful inputs. This includes scaling, normalization, one-hot encoding, and handling missing values. Good features significantly impact model performance.

Model evaluation uses metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Cross-validation ensures reliable performance assessment by testing on multiple data splits.

Overfitting occurs when models learn noise in training data, while underfitting happens when models are too simple. Regularization and proper model selection help balance this trade-off.

Deep learning uses neural networks with multiple layers. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) excel in image processing, while Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) handle sequential data.

Model deployment involves saving trained models, creating APIs, and monitoring performance. MLOps practices ensure reliable model maintenance and updates in production.
