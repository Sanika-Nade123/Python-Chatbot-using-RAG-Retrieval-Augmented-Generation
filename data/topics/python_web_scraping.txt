Web scraping in Python typically uses libraries like Beautiful Soup and requests. Requests handles HTTP operations while Beautiful Soup parses HTML.

HTML parsing extracts data using selectors like find(), find_all(), select(). CSS selectors and tag names identify elements of interest.

Request handling includes managing headers, cookies, and sessions. Response objects contain status codes, content, and headers.

Rate limiting and delays prevent server overload. User-agent rotation and proxy usage help avoid blocking during large-scale scraping.

Error handling manages connection issues, timeout errors, and invalid HTML. Robust scrapers include retry mechanisms.

Data extraction often combines multiple techniques including regex, string operations, and HTML parsing for complex web pages.
