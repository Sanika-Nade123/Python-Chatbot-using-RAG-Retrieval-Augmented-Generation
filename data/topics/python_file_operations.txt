File reading operations use various modes: 'r' for reading, 'rb' for binary reading. readlines() reads all lines into a list.

File writing uses 'w' mode for new files, 'a' for appending. write() and writelines() handle text output.

File deletion uses os.remove() function. Directory operations use os.rmdir() for empty directories.

File existence checking prevents errors. os.path.exists() verifies file presence before operations.

Binary file handling requires special modes and methods. struct module helps with binary data formats.

File system operations include renaming, moving, and copying files. shutil module provides high-level operations.
