Regular expressions (regex) in Python use the re module. They provide powerful pattern matching and text manipulation capabilities.

Basic patterns include literal characters, character classes ([]), quantifiers (*, +, ?), and anchors (^, $). The raw string notation (r'') prevents escape character issues.

Common methods include search(), match(), findall(), and sub(). Search finds patterns anywhere, while match looks only at the start of the string.

Groups in regex capture parts of matches using parentheses. Named groups (?P<name>) make references more readable and maintainable.

Compilation of regex patterns using re.compile() improves performance when the same pattern is used multiple times.

Special sequences like \d (digits), \w (word characters), and \s (whitespace) simplify common pattern matching tasks.
