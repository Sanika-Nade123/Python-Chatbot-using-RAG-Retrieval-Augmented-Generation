Dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value pairs in Python. Each key must be unique and immutable, while values can be of any type.

Dictionary methods include keys(), values(), items(), get(), update(), pop(), and clear(). The get() method safely retrieves values without raising KeyError.

Dictionary comprehensions provide a concise way to create dictionaries, similar to list comprehensions. They can include conditions and transformations.

Nested dictionaries are dictionaries containing other dictionaries, useful for representing complex hierarchical data structures.

Dictionary keys must be hashable (immutable), so lists can't be keys but tuples can. Values can be modified even if they're mutable objects.

Modern Python maintains insertion order of dictionaries since version 3.7, making them more predictable when iterating.
