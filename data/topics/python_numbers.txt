Python supports several numeric types: integers (int), floating-point numbers (float), and complex numbers (complex).

Integer arithmetic handles arbitrary precision automatically. Division operations include true division (/) and floor division (//).

Floating-point numbers follow IEEE-754 standard. Decimal module provides exact decimal arithmetic for financial calculations.

Complex numbers include real and imaginary parts. The j suffix denotes imaginary components.

Numeric type conversion follows precision rules. Operations between different numeric types promote to the more precise type.

Mathematical functions in math module operate on numbers. Special values include infinity (float('inf')) and NaN.
