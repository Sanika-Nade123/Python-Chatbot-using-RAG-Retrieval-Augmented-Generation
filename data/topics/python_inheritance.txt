Inheritance enables code reuse by creating new classes based on existing ones. Child classes inherit attributes and methods from parent classes.

Multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit from multiple parent classes. Method Resolution Order (MRO) determines method lookup sequence.

Super() function calls methods from parent class. It's particularly useful in multiple inheritance scenarios.

Method overriding allows child classes to provide specific implementations. Parent class methods can still be accessed using super().

Abstract base classes define interfaces using abc module. They ensure derived classes implement required methods.

Inheritance hierarchies should be designed carefully to avoid complexity and maintain clear relationships between classes.
