PIP (Package Installer for Python) manages Python packages and dependencies. It downloads and installs packages from the Python Package Index (PyPI).

Common commands include install, uninstall, list, and freeze. Requirements files specify project dependencies for easy environment setup.

Virtual environments isolate project dependencies. The venv module creates isolated Python environments for different projects.

Package versioning ensures compatibility. Version specifiers like ==, >=, <= control which package versions are installed.

Pip can install from various sources including PyPI, Git repositories, and local files. Wheel files provide pre-built package distributions.

Cache management and upgrade operations keep packages current. The --no-cache-dir flag forces fresh downloads of packages.
