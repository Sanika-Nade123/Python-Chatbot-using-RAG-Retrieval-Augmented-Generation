Arrays in Python typically use NumPy arrays for efficient numerical operations. They differ from Python lists by requiring homogeneous data types.

Array operations are vectorized, performing element-wise operations without explicit loops. This improves performance significantly.

Array creation methods include array(), zeros(), ones(), and arange(). Shape and dtype parameters define array structure.

Array indexing supports integer, boolean, and fancy indexing. Slicing works similar to lists but can be multi-dimensional.

Array broadcasting enables operations between arrays of different shapes. It follows specific rules for shape compatibility.

Memory efficiency makes arrays preferred for numerical computations. They're fundamental to scientific computing in Python.
