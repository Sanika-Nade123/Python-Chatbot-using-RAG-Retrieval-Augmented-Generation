NumPy is fundamental for scientific computing in Python. Its main object is the multi-dimensional array, which enables efficient operations on large datasets.

Array operations in NumPy are vectorized, meaning they operate on entire arrays without explicit loops, making computations faster.

NumPy provides tools for linear algebra, Fourier transforms, and random number generation. Its broadcasting rules allow operations between arrays of different shapes.

Array indexing and slicing in NumPy is powerful, supporting boolean indexing, integer indexing, and fancy indexing for complex selections.

Mathematical functions in NumPy include trigonometric, statistical, and algebraic operations. These are optimized for performance on large datasets.

NumPy arrays can be reshaped, stacked, split, and concatenated. They form the foundation for data analysis libraries like Pandas and scikit-learn.
