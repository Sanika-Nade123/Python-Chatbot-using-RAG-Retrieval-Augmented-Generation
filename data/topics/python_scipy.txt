SciPy builds on NumPy for scientific and technical computing. It provides modules for optimization, linear algebra, integration, and interpolation.

Optimization functions solve minimization and root finding problems. Methods include minimize(), root(), and curve_fit() for various optimization tasks.

Signal processing tools handle digital signals, including filtering, convolution, and Fourier transforms. Window functions help in spectral analysis.

Statistical functions provide distributions, statistical tests, and descriptive statistics. Integration with other scientific libraries enhances capabilities.

Image processing capabilities include filters, transformations, and feature detection. The ndimage submodule provides multi-dimensional image processing.

Special functions include mathematical physics functions, information theory, and other specialized mathematical operations.
