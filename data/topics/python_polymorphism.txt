Polymorphism in Python allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. Method overriding enables different implementations.

Duck typing implements polymorphism without inheritance. If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's treated as a duck.

Method overriding occurs when derived classes provide specific implementations of methods defined in base classes.

Abstract base classes define interfaces using the abc module. They ensure derived classes implement required methods.

Operator overloading customizes how operators work with custom objects. Special methods like __add__ and __mul__ enable this.

Interface polymorphism allows objects to work with any type that supports required operations, promoting flexible code design.
