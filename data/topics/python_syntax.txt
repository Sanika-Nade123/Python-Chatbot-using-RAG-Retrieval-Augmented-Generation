Python syntax emphasizes readability and simplicity. Indentation is used to define code blocks, unlike other languages that use curly braces or keywords.

Python statements typically end with a newline, though they can span multiple lines using backslashes or parentheses. Semicolons are optional and rarely used.

Variables in Python don't need explicit declaration. They are created when first assigned a value and can store different types of data dynamically.

Python uses indentation (typically 4 spaces) to define blocks of code. This enforced indentation makes code more readable and consistent across different Python programs.

Comments in Python start with #, and multi-line comments use triple quotes (''' or """). Good commenting practices are essential for code maintainability.

Python's syntax is designed to be intuitive. For example, the range() function, list comprehensions, and slicing notation make common programming tasks more straightforward.
