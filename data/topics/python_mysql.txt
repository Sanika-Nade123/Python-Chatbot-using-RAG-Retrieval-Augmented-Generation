MySQL integration in Python uses the mysql-connector-python module. It enables creating connections, executing queries, and managing databases.

Database connections require host, username, password, and database name. Connection pooling improves performance for multiple database operations.

CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) are performed using SQL queries through cursor objects. Parameterized queries prevent SQL injection.

Transaction management ensures data integrity. The commit() method saves changes, while rollback() undoes them if errors occur.

Error handling is crucial for database operations. Try-except blocks manage common database exceptions like connection errors or constraint violations.

Result sets can be fetched using fetchall(), fetchone(), or fetchmany() methods. Results can be easily converted to Python data structures.
