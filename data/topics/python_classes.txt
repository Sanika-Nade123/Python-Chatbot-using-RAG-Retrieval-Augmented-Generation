Classes are blueprints for creating objects in Python. They encapsulate data and behavior using attributes and methods.

The __init__ method is the constructor, called when creating new instances. Self parameter refers to the instance being created.

Class attributes are shared among all instances, while instance attributes are unique to each object. Methods define the behavior of objects.

Inheritance allows creating new classes based on existing ones. Python supports multiple inheritance, allowing a class to inherit from multiple parent classes.

Special methods (magic methods) like __str__, __len__, __eq__ customize object behavior. They're called automatically in specific situations.

Properties allow controlling access to attributes using getter and setter methods, enabling data validation and encapsulation.
