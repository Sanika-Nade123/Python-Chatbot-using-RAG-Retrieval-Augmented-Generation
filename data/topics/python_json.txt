JSON handling in Python uses the json module. It converts between Python objects and JSON strings through serialization and deserialization.

dumps() converts Python objects to JSON strings, while loads() parses JSON strings into Python objects. Pretty printing makes output more readable.

Complex objects can be serialized using custom encoders. The default parameter in json.dumps() handles non-serializable objects.

File operations with JSON use dump() and load() for direct file reading and writing. Context managers ensure proper file handling.

JSON data types map to Python types: objects to dictionaries, arrays to lists, strings to str, numbers to int or float, and null to None.

Error handling catches JSON parsing errors like JSONDecodeError when working with invalid JSON data.
