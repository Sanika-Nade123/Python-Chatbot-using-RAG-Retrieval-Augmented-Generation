Algorithm represents a step-by-step procedure to solve a problem. Time complexity (Big O notation) measures algorithm efficiency, while space complexity considers memory usage.

Data structures organize and store data. Common structures include arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, stacks, and queues. Each has specific use cases and performance characteristics.

Version control systems like Git track code changes. Branches enable parallel development, while commits record changes. Pull requests facilitate code review and collaboration.

Debugging identifies and fixes code issues. Tools include breakpoints, watch windows, and logging. Common debugging strategies are print debugging and step-through debugging.

API (Application Programming Interface) defines how software components interact. RESTful APIs use HTTP methods for web services, while libraries provide programmatic interfaces.

Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems. Examples include Singleton, Factory, Observer, and MVC patterns. They promote code maintainability and reusability.
