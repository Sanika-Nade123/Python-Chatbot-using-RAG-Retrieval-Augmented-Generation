Mean, median, and mode measure central tendency. NumPy and statistics modules provide these calculations efficiently.

Standard deviation quantifies data spread. The std() function in NumPy calculates population or sample standard deviation.

Percentiles indicate value distribution. They help identify outliers and understand data distribution.

Data distribution analysis uses histograms and probability plots. Normal distribution is particularly important in statistics.

Linear regression finds relationships between variables. The least squares method minimizes prediction errors.

Cross-validation assesses model performance. K-fold cross-validation provides robust performance estimates.
