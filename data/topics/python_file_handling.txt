File handling in Python involves reading from and writing to files. The open() function creates a file object with specified mode (read, write, append).

Text files can be read line by line using readline() or all at once using read(). The with statement ensures proper file closure after operations.

Writing to files uses write() for strings and writelines() for lists of strings. The mode 'w' overwrites existing content, while 'a' appends to it.

Binary files handle non-text data using 'rb' and 'wb' modes. They're useful for images, audio, and other binary data formats.

File operations include checking existence, deleting files, renaming files, and managing directories using the os and pathlib modules.

Exception handling is crucial in file operations to manage common issues like FileNotFoundError or PermissionError.
