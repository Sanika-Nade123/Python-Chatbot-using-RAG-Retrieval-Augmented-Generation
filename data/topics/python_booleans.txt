Boolean values in Python are True and False. They're special instances of int class, with True being 1 and False being 0.

Boolean operations include and, or, not. Short-circuit evaluation optimizes these operations.

Comparison operators return boolean values. These include ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=.

Truth value testing applies to all objects. Empty containers, zero, and None are considered False.

Boolean context occurs in if statements, while loops, and conditional expressions.

Custom classes can define __bool__() method to control truth value testing behavior.
