MongoDB integration in Python uses pymongo client. It provides asynchronous operations and CRUD functionality for document-based data.

Collections in MongoDB are analogous to tables in relational databases. Documents are stored in BSON format, similar to JSON.

Queries use dictionary-like syntax for filtering, sorting, and projecting data. Aggregation pipelines enable complex data transformations.

Indexes improve query performance. MongoDB supports various index types including single field, compound, and text indexes.

Updates can modify single or multiple documents. Atomic operations ensure data consistency in concurrent environments.

GridFS allows storing large files in MongoDB. It automatically splits files into chunks for efficient storage and retrieval.
