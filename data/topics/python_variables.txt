Variables in Python are containers for storing data values. Unlike other languages, Python variables don't need explicit type declaration and can change types dynamically.

Variable names must start with a letter or underscore, followed by letters, numbers, or underscores. They are case-sensitive, so 'name' and 'Name' are different variables.

Python supports multiple assignment, allowing you to assign values to multiple variables in a single line. For example: x, y, z = 1, 2, 3.

Global variables are declared outside functions and can be used throughout the program. Local variables are declared within functions and have function scope.

Python uses dynamic typing, meaning you can reassign variables to different data types. The type() function helps determine a variable's current type.

Variable naming conventions follow PEP 8 style guide: lowercase with underscores for regular variables, UPPERCASE for constants, and CamelCase for classes.
