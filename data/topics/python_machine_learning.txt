Machine learning in Python primarily uses scikit-learn library. It provides tools for classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction.

Data preprocessing includes scaling, normalization, and handling missing values. The train_test_split function separates data for training and testing.

Supervised learning algorithms include Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines. Model evaluation uses metrics like accuracy and precision.

Unsupervised learning encompasses clustering algorithms like K-means and hierarchical clustering. Dimensionality reduction includes PCA and t-SNE.

Cross-validation techniques assess model performance. GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV help in hyperparameter tuning.

Model persistence allows saving trained models using pickle or joblib, enabling deployment in production environments.
