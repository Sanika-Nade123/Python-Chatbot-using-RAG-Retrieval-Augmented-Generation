Lambda functions are anonymous, single-expression functions. They're created using the lambda keyword and can take any number of arguments.

Common uses include sorting with custom keys, mapping operations, and creating simple function objects on the fly.

Lambda functions work well with higher-order functions like map(), filter(), and reduce(). They provide concise ways to transform data.

Function composition using lambda creates chains of operations. This enables functional programming patterns in Python.

Lambda limitations include single expression restriction and lack of documentation strings. Regular functions are preferred for complex operations.

Lambda functions are particularly useful in GUI programming for event handlers and callback functions.
