Python basics include variables, data types, operators, and control flow statements. Variables are containers for storing data values.

Python variables don't need explicit declaration. They are created when you first assign a value.

Python data types include: integers (int), floating-point numbers (float), strings (str), lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets.

Control flow statements in Python include if-else conditions, for loops, while loops, and switch-case (using match in Python 3.10+).
